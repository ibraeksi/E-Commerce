# E-Commerce Marketplace Analysis Using Olist Data

In this project, I will be using the Olist dataset to conduct an in-depth analysis to answer one guiding question: how do we increase customer satisfaction (and with it our profit margin) while maintaining a healthy volume of orders?

The analysis is hosted on Streamlit and can be viewed on:
